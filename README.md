# OpenSim-webpanel-cgrid
my old crying grid panel will be here so it never gets lost

to install just move the files on the /var/www or wherever your apache/nginx configuration is located

and copy the opensim configuration folder onto your opensim configuration, or if you don't want to move anything
just add the remote admin on the Robust.ini and change the password in the files
